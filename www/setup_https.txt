OVERVIEW

HTTPS mode is an experimental feature in moOde that enables secure communication
between the Browser and moOde/NGINX web server. This is achieved through use of
an automatically or manually generated security certificate (cert).

Automatically Generated (Self-Signed)

This type of cert is automatically created and installed into NGINX web server
when HTTPS mode is turned on. The cert can be downloaded via the DOWNLOAD button
or Browser Export option and then a manual procedure is required to import the
cert into the client Operating System (OS) certificate store. After this is done
the Browser will be able to establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde.

Manually Generated

This type of cert is manually created and can be self-signed or signed by a
local Certificate Authority (CA) then manually installed into NGINX web server
via the UPLOAD and INSTALL buttons. A second manual procedure is used to import
the cert into the client Operating System (OS) certificate Store. After this is
done the Browser will be able to establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde.

CONFIGURING HTTPS MODE

Below is a basic procedure for configuring HTTPS mode. The steps to install the
cert into the client OS certificate store vary depending on the OS.

First, open moOde on a desktop OS for example MacOS.

1. HTTPS mode on

a. Open System Config and scroll to the Security section
b. Set the Certificate type to "Automatic"
c. Turn HTTPS mode on
d. DOWNLOAD the cert
e. Install the downloaded cert into the OS certificate store and set its trust
   policy to "Always trust". This terminology may vary depending on the OS.
f. Reboot moOde
g. Refresh the Browser and a secure HTTPS connection should be established

2. HTTPS mode off

a. Open System Config and scroll to the Security section
b. Turn HTTPS mode OFF
c. Reboot
d. Open http://moode
e. A non-secure HTTP connection should be established

3. Changing the host name

If the host name is changed via System Config while HTTPS mode is on and the
Certificate type was set to "Automatic" a new self-signed cert will be generated
automatically and installed into NGINX web server during startup after reboot.

a. Refresh the Browser
b. Click the browser "Security warning" badge to view the cert
c. Navigate to an option that offers an "Export" button
d. Click the Export button
e. Select DER encoding format
f. Export/Download the cert
g. Install the downloaded cert into the client OS certificate store and set its
   trust policy to "Always trust"

IMPORTING CERTS INTO DESKTOP AND MOBILE OS

MacOS:
  - Double click the cert
  - Auto-opens the Keychain Access app
  - Install the cert into the System store
  - Double click the installed cert
  - Set its trust policy to "Always trust"
  - Done

IOS:
  - First attach the cert to an email on another client
  - Open the email on IOS
  - Click the cert icon to download the "Profile"
  - Open Settings>General>VPN and Device Management
  - Under CONFIGURATON PROFILE, click and install the cert profile
  - Open Settings>General>About>Certificate Trust Settings
  - Click the slider to trust the cert
  - Done
