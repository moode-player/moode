OVERVIEW

HTTPS mode is an experimental feature in moOde System Config that enables secure
communication between the Browser and moOde/NGINX web server through use of an
automatically or manually generated Security Certificate [Cert].

Automatically Generated Cert (Self-Signed)

This type of Cert is automatically created and installed into NGINX web server
when HTTPS mode is turned on. The Cert can be downloaded via the DOWNLOAD button
or Browser Export option and then a manual procedure is required to import the
Cert into the client Operating System (OS) Certificate Store. After this is done
the Browser will be able to establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde.

Manually Generated Cert

This type of Cert is manually created and can be self-signed or signed by a
local Certificate Authority (CA) then manually installed into NGINX web server
via the UPLOAD and INSTALL buttons. A second manual procedure is used to import
the Cert into the client OS Certificate Store. After this is
done the Browser will be able to establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde.

CONFIGURING HTTPS MODE

Below is the procedure for configuring HTTPS mode. The steps to install the Cert
into the client OS Certificate Store vary depending on the OS.

First, open moOde on a desktop OS.

HTTPS Mode: ON

    1. Open System Config and scroll to the Security section
    2. Set the Certificate type to "Automatic"
    3. Turn HTTPS mode ON
    4. DOWNLOAD the Cert
    5. Install the downloaded Cert into the client OS Certificate Store and set its
       trust policy to "Always trust" (this terminology varies depending on the OS)
    6. Reboot moOde
    7. Refresh the Browser and a secure HTTPS connection should be established

HTTPS Mode: OFF

    1. Open System Config and scroll to the Security section
    2. Turn HTTPS mode OFF
    3. Reboot
    4. Open http://moode
    5. A non-secure HTTP connection should be established
    6. You may need to clear the Browser cache

Changing the host name

If the host name is changed via System Config while HTTPS Mode is ON and the
Certificate type was set to "Automatic" a new self-signed Cert will be generated
automatically and installed into NGINX web server during startup after reboot.

    1. Refresh the Browser
    2. Click the browser "Security warning" badge to view the Cert
    3. Navigate to an option that offers an "Export" button
    4. Click the Export button
    5. Select DER encoding format
    6. Export/Download the Cert
    7. Install the Cert into the client OS Certificate Store and set its trust
       policy to "Always trust"
