GENERAL INFORMATION

Access the moOde WebUI using a Browser and one of the URL's below. Configuration
and other options are available via the "m" moOde menu.

- http://moode
- http://moode.local
- http://IP_ADDRESS

An explanation of how to operate moOde audio player is contained in Quick help
located on the moOde menu and also at the link below.
https://github.com/moode-player/docs/blob/main/Quickhelp.pdf

SECURITY AND OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) IMAGE

For improved security the OS image does not contain the userid pi, SSH service,
WiFi SSID or Access Point password.

  *** READ 1 & 2 BELOW ***

  1. The official Raspberry Pi Imager is REQUIRED to enable SSH, create a userid
  and password and optionally set the host name and WiFi SSID and password. If a
  host name is not set in the Imager then the default hostname "moode" will be
  used.

  2. SSH and userid/password are REQUIRED for correct operation of moOde. Failure
  to set these will result in a non-functional player and WebUI.

- An Access Point password can be set using the Network Configuration screen
  after accessing the moOde WebUI, or before first boot via a moodecfg.ini
  file as described in the CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS section.

- The moOde OS images are listed in the "Media Player OS" category of the Pi
  Imager, or if they were downloaded directly via the Download page at
  http://moodeaudio.org they can be selected via the "Use custom" category.

- Refer to the links below for more information on operating system security
  and how to download and use the Raspberry Pi Imager.
  https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
  https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/

To access the OS command console use Secure Shell (SSH). An easy to use WebSSH
terminal is available in the WebUI, System Config screen.

ACCESS POINT (AP) MODE

To use to Access Point (AP) mode which is moOde's private 2.4 GHz WiFi network
refer to the settings below.

- IP address    172.24.1.1
- SSID          Moode
- Password      Refer to the SECURITY section
- Channel       6

AP mode starts automatically when any of the following are true.

- WiFi SSID is set to "None (activates AP mode)" in Network Config, Router
  mode is Off and there is no active Ethernet connection.

- WiFi SSID is defined in Network Config but no IP address was assigned after
  attempting to connect to the SSID and there is no active Ethernet connection.

- Router mode is On in Network Config and either WiFi SSID is defined but no IP
  address was assigned or SSID is set to "None (activates AP mode)". An active
  Ethernet connection is required for Router mode to function but it does not
  need to be active at the time AP Router mode starts.

FILE SHARING

- SMB File Sharing can be turned on in System Config. SMB (Samba) shares named
  NAS, Playlists, and SDCard are automatically created. Each USB disk will also
  have a Samba share created that is named after its Disk Label.

- NFS File Sharing can be turned on in System Config. Access and options defaults
  are provided but can be manually overridden. Each USB disk will have an NFS
  export created whose path is /media/disk_label.

WIFI ADAPTERS THAT ARE REPORTED TO SUPPORT Access Point (AP) MODE

- Raspberry Pi integrated WiFi adapter
- Comfast CF-912AC dual-band WiFi adapter
- For all other adapters consult the manufacturer

IN-PLACE SOFTWARE UPDATES

- Updates to moOde software are made available periodically and can be downloaded
  and installed by clicking "CHECK for software update" in System Config.
- Click VIEW to see a list of what is contained in the update package.
- Click INSTALL to download and install the update package.
