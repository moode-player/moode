GENERAL INFORMATION

Access moOde using a Browser and one of the URL's below. After opening moOde
in the Browser use the IOS or Android "Save to Home Screen" option to create a
moOde App on your home screen. There is no need to download anything.
http://moode, http://moode.local or http://IP_ADDRESS

OPERATING ISTRUCTIONS

Instructions for configuring and operating moOde are contained in Quick help
which is located on the "m" menu and at the link below.
https://github.com/moode-player/docs/blob/main/Quickhelp.pdf

MOODE OS IMAGE

For improved security the OS image does not contain a userid, WiFi SSID or
Access Point password, and Secure Shell (SSH) access is disabled.

  1. REQUIRED: The official Raspberry Pi Imager is required to enable SSH,
  create a userid and password and optionally set the host name and WiFi SSID
  and password. If a host name is not set in the Imager then the default
  host name "moode" will be used.

  2. REQUIRED: Userid, password and SSH are required otherwise moOde will not
  function correctly. When enabling SSH, select "Use password authentication"
  which means the password specified for the userid is to be used. 

  3. REQUIRED: An Access Point password is required and is set after first boot
  in the Network Configuration screen. This allows moOde to still be accessable
  if it cannot connect to Ethernet or any configrred WiFi SSID's.

- OS images are listed in the "Media Player OS" category of the Raspberry Pi
  Imager, or if they were downloaded directly from moodeaudio.org they can be
  selected via the "Use custom" category in the Imager.

- Refer to the links below for more information on operating system security
  and how to download and use the Raspberry Pi Imager.
  https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
  https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/

To access the OS command console use SSH. An easy to use WebSSH terminal is
available in the System Config screen.

ACCESS POINT (AP) MODE

To use Access Point (AP) mode which is moOde's private 2.4 GHz WiFi network
refer to the settings below.

- IP address    172.24.1.1
- SSID          Moode
- Password      As set in Network Config screen
- Channel       6

AP mode starts automatically when any of the following are true.

- WiFi SSID is set to "None (activates AP mode)" in Network Config, Router
  mode is Off and there is no active Ethernet connection.

- WiFi SSID is defined in Network Config but no IP address was assigned after
  attempting to connect to the SSID and there is no active Ethernet connection.

- Router mode is On in Network Config and either WiFi SSID is defined but no IP
  address was assigned or SSID is set to "None (activates AP mode)". An active
  Ethernet connection is required for Router mode to function but it does not
  need to be active at the time AP Router mode starts.

FILE SHARING

- SMB File Sharing can be turned on in System Config. SMB (Samba) shares named
  NAS, Playlists, and SDCard are automatically created. Each USB disk will also
  have a Samba share created that is named after its Disk Label.

- NFS File Sharing can be turned on in System Config. Access and options defaults
  are provided but can be manually overridden. Each USB disk will have an NFS
  export created whose path is /media/disk_label.

WIFI ADAPTERS THAT ARE REPORTED TO SUPPORT Access Point (AP) MODE

- Raspberry Pi integrated WiFi adapter
- Comfast CF-912AC dual-band WiFi adapter
- For all other adapters consult the manufacturer

IN-PLACE SOFTWARE UPDATES

- Updates to moOde software are made available periodically and can be downloaded
  and installed by clicking "CHECK for software update" in System Config.
- Click VIEW to see a list of what is contained in the update package.
- Click INSTALL to download and install the update package.
