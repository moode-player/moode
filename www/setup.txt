GENERAL INFORMATION

To access the moOde UI open a Web Browser and enter one of the URL's below. The
system is configured via the "m" menu Configure and Preferences selections.

- http://moode
- http://moode.local
- http://IP_ADDRESS

An explanation of how to operate moOde audio player can be found in Quick help
which is located on the main (m) menu.

To access the operating system command console use Secure Shell (SSH). An easy
to use Web SSH terminal is available in System Config.

- Userid    pi
- Password  moodeaudio

ACCESS POINT (AP) MODE

To use to Access Point (AP) mode which is moOde's private 2.4 GHz WiFi network
refer to the settings below.

- IP address    172.24.1.1
- SSID          Moode
- Password      moodeaudio
- Channel       6

AP mode starts automatically when any of the following are true.

- WiFi SSID is set to "None (activates AP mode)" in Network Config, Router
  mode is Off and there is no active Ethernet connection.

- WiFi SSID is defined in Network Config but no IP address was assigned after
  attempting to connect to the SSID and there is no active Ethernet connection.

- Router mode is On in Network Config and either WiFi SSID is defined but no IP
  address was assigned or SSID is set to "None (activates AP mode)". An active
  Ethernet connection is required for Router mode to function but it does not
  need to be active at the time AP Router mode starts.

FILE SHARING

- SMB File Sharing can be turned On in System Config. SMB (Samba) shares named
  NAS, Playlists, and SDCard are automatically created. Each USB disk will also
  have a Samba share created that is named after its Disk Label.

- NFS File Sharing can be turned On in System Config. Access and options defaults
  are provided but can be manually overridden. Each USB disk will have an NFS
  export created whose path is /media/disk_label.

WIFI ADAPTERS THAT ARE REPORTED TO SUPPORT Access Point (AP) MODE

- Raspberry Pi integrated WiFi adapter
- Comfast CF-912AC dual-band WiFi adapter
- For all other adapters consult the manufacturer

IN-PLACE SOFTWARE UPDATES
