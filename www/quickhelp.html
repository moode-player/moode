<h5>General</h5>
<p>There are four main sections to moOde: Configuration, Preferences, Playback and Library.</p>
<p>Switching between Playback and the Library is accomplished by clicking on the cover art in Playback or on any open area of the Playbar in the Library.</p>

<h5>Configuration</h5>
<p>The Configuration screens are accessed via the Main Menu and provide options for setting up the music library, configuring audio devices, defining network connections, enabling system services, connecting to peripheral devices, and activating 3rd party audio renderers. Typically these options are configured initially and then infrequently changed.</p>

<h5>Preferences</h5>
<p>The Preferences screen is accessed via the Main Menu and provide settings for WebUI Appearance, Playback, Cover Art, Library and CoverView.</p>

<h5>Playback</h5>
<p>The Playback screen includes the play queue (Queue), volume and time knobs, playback controls, cover art and metadata.

<h5>Library</h5>
<p>The library provides Radio, Folder, Tag, Album and Playlist views for browsing and selecting content and a Playbar for displaying song information and controlling playback. Options for configuring various aspects of the Library including sort order, recently added and more are located in the Library section of Preferences.</p>

<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Cover art</span>
			<p>The Cover Art section of Preferences contains settings for specifying cover art resolution, whether to search first for embedded image or cover image file and which audio formats are included.</p>
			<p>NOTE: Some Albums for example "Nine Inch Nails - The Slip" have a main cover image file and also embedded covers in each track. To display the covers correctly first add the cover image file named so its the last file in the album directory, then set Prefs > "Cover search priority" to "Embedded" and Prefs > "Audio formats" to "Default+"</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Music metadata</span>
			<p>For a list of metadata tags supported by moOde view the <a href="https://github.com/moode-player/docs/blob/main/music_metadata.md" class="target-blank-link" target="_blank">Music Metadata</a> documentation</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Artist and Album Artist tags</span>
			<p>When the Library is generated it creates a virtual Artist tag that includes Artists, Performers and Conductor, and a virtual Album Artist tag that is set to Album Artist if it exists otherwise to the first element of the virtual Artist tag. The Library section of Preferences contains settings for specifying how to populate the Artist column in Tag view.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Date tags</span>
			<p>The date tag that is used is determined by the following priority: OriginalDate, OriginalReleaseDate, Date. The format for the value must be YYYY or YYYYMMDD otherwise any Library sort involving year will not be correct. The year YYYY portion of the date is used for display.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Special AlbumDate tag</span>
			<p>The string "AlbumDate: YYYYMM" at the beginning of the Comment tag can be used to add month to the the sort order. This is to support correct sort order for multiple Albums released by the same artist within a year.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h5>Searching the Library</h5>
<p>Powerful search features are available that allow the Library to be filtered based on entered text, tag value pairs or special, predefined filters. There is also an Advanced search dialog that enables multiple tag value pairs to be submitted.</p>
<p>Tag and Album views</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> General</span>
			<p>Searches are not case sensitive and partial matches are the default unless one of the strict comparison operators '==' or '!=' is used. The comparison operators '=~' or '!~' can also be used to perform searches based on PERL regular expressions. Searches are cleared by clicking on the "Filtered by" heading.</p>
			<p>NOTE: The "search" field only supports a single tag value pair or a single Predefined filter.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Tag value pairs</span>
			<p>The following tags are supported: Any, Genre, Artist, Album, Title, Album Artist, Date, Composer, Conductor, Performer, Work, Comment and File.</p>
			<p>Examples: genre rock | artist frank sinatra | artist mccartney | any zeppelin</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> The Any tag</span>
			<p>The Any tag performs a search of all tags using an OR relationship. An Any search is automatically invoked when the first word of text entered in the "search" field does not match any of the tag or predefined filter names.</p>
			<p>Examples: yellow submarine | all that you can't leave behind | frank sinatra | 1962</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Predefined filters</span>
			<p>The following predefined filters are available: Encoded [bits/rate | Nch | multichannel], Format [.ext], Folder [path], HDonly, Lossless, Lossy and Year [yyyy] or [yyyy-yyyy].</p>
			<p>Examples: encoded 24/96 | encoded 192 | encoded 24 | encoded 6ch | encoded multichannel | hdonly | format .dsf | folder u2/achtung baby | lossy | year 1962 | year 1994-1998</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Saved searches</span>
			<p>Searches can be saved and subsequently activated using the "Saved searches" item on the Library dropdown menu.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>Folder view</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> General</span>

<h5>CoverView</h5>
<p>The CoverView screen saver provides a large sized cover art image or optional Analog or Digital clock, a Playbar for controlling playback and several backdrop options that can be selected in the CoverView section of Preferences.</p>

<h5>Queue</h5>
<p>The Queue is displayed in Playback and CoverView and contains all items to be played. It's populated primarily by selecting an item from the Library and then clicking one of the Queue commands listed on a context menu. It can also be populated automatically by Auto-shuffle. The Queue commands are listed below.</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Add | Play</span>
			<p>The "Add" command adds the item to the end of the Queue. The "Play" command first checks to see if the item is already in the Queue and then plays the existing item otherwise it does the same as Add and then begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Clear/Play</span>
			<p>The "Clear/Play" command first clears the Queue then adds the item and begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Add next | Play next</span>
			<p>The "Add next" command adds the item immediately after the currently playing or last played item. The "Play next" command first checks to see if the item is already in the Queue and then plays the existing item otherwise it does the same as "Add next" then begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Clear queue</span>
			<p>This command is available in the ellipsis context menu in Playback view and on the Playbar.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>For the track list in Library Tag and Album views the Play and Clear/Play actions can be configured via a Preferences option to either add the selected track to the Queue or the selected track and all following tracks.</p>
		</li
	</ul>
</div>

<h5>Playlists</h5>
<p> Creating, editing and managing playlists is done primarily in Library Playlist view. Playlists can also be created via context menu items "Save Queue to playlist", "Set Favorites name" and "Add to playlist".</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Save Queue to playlist</span>
			<p>The "Save Queue to playlist" command displays a list of available playlists and adds the item to the end of the selected playlist or a new playlist if one is specified.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Set Favorites name</span>
			<p>The "Set Favorites name" command displays an input form for specifying the name of the playlist that contains items favorited by clicking the Heart <i class="fa-regular fa-sharp fa-heart"></i> button. If the playlist does not already exist it will be created.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Add to playlist</span>

</div>

<h5>Multiroom audio</h5>
<p>A multiroom audio system consists of a Sender and Receivers. The Sender should be a dedicated Pi not connected to speakers or headphones. For additional information view the <a href="./setup_multiroom.txt" class="target-blank-link" target="_blank">Multiroom setup guide</a></p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Configuration</span>
			<p>Sender and Receiver options are configured in Multiroom Config which is accessed via Menu/Configure or in the ALSA section of Audio Config. Audio sources including MPD, AirPlay and Spotify can be distributed by the Sender.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Master volume</span>
			<p>The volume knob on the Sender system provides master volume control by sending the volume change to the Receivers which apply it to their own volume. Receivers can be configured to opt in or out of Master volume control via Multiroom Config.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Receiver control</span>
			<p>Receivers can be centrally controlled from the Sender system via the Receivers panel which is accessed via the&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-sharp fa-speakers"></i>&nbsp;button at the top of Playback view or the Receivers item in the ellipsis context menu in Playback view and on the Playbar.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Networking</span>
			<p>The performance of the system depends on having low latency, high throughput networking and hosts. Discovery of Receivers relies on Multicast DNS. Addressing for the audio distribution protocol relies on IP Multicast using a default address of 239.0.0.1.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Audio format</span>
			<p>The system uses 16 bit 48 kHz PCM format encoded using the Opus CODEC. Resampling if needed is handled by ALSA using the Speex converter.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
