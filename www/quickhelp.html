	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>
		The UI has two main parts: Library and Configuration. The Library has four views for selecting content including Radio, Folder, Tag and Album and a Playbar for controlling playback.  
		Toggling between the Playbar and full screen Playback is accomplished by tapping on the cover or the bar icon. The Configuration screens are accessed via the Main Menu.
