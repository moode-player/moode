#
# Four Mitra-Regalia peaking equaliser filters in series; a vector arithmetic
# re-implementation of Fons Adriaensens "Parametric1" equaliser[fafil] with
# minor differences.â€‚Parallelisation of the serial filter organisation causes
# the output to lag by three samples. The bandwidth control sets the bandwidth
# of a single filter, lower values corresponding to increasing resonance (Q).
#
# Second order filters are capable of resonance (or anti-resonance) around a
# particular frequency. The response of a second order filter is specified not
# only by its frequency but its Q; a higher Q corresponds to a sharper response
# (narrower bandwidth) around a particular center frequency.
#
# There are four sets of four numbers (Enable/Disable, Frequency, Bandwidth, Gain). The final number is overall gain.
# - Enable/disable:	1/0
# - Frequency:		20 - 14000 Hz (Center Frequency)
# - Bandwidth:		0.12 - 8 (Q factor) must have leading 0 if < 1
# - Gain:			-24 - 24 dB
# - Master Gain		-24 - 24 dB
