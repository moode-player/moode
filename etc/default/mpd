## Defaults for the MPD init script, sourced by /etc/init.d/mpd on Debian
## systems.  Uncomment (remove the leading '#') and change values as needed.

## If you don't want MPD to be started as a system service (for example, if
## you want to run it from a regular user account), disable it using the
## command 'update-rc.d mpd disable'

## The configuration file location for mpd:
MPDCONF=/etc/mpd.conf
