# This is the configuration file for the MiniDLNA daemon, a DLNA/UPnP-AV media
# server.
#
# Unless otherwise noted, the commented out options show their default value.
#
# On Debian, you can also refer to the minidlna.conf(5) man page for
# documentation about this file.
#

# Specify the user name or uid to run as.
#user=minidlna

# Path to the directory you want scanned for media files.
#
# This option can be specified more than once if you want multiple directories
# scanned.
#
# If you want to restrict a media_dir to a specific content type, you can
# prepend the directory name with a letter representing the type (A, P or V),
# followed by a comma, as so:
#   * "A" for audio    (eg. media_dir=A,/var/lib/minidlna/music)
#   * "P" for pictures (eg. media_dir=P,/var/lib/minidlna/pictures)
#   * "V" for video    (eg. media_dir=V,/var/lib/minidlna/videos)
#   * "PV" for pictures and video (eg. media_dir=PV,/var/lib/minidlna/digital_camera)
media_dir=A,/var/lib/mpd/music

# Set this to merge all media_dir base contents into the root container
# (The default is no.)
#merge_media_dirs=no

# Path to the directory that should hold the database and album art cache.
db_dir=/var/cache/minidlna

# Path to the directory that should hold the log file.
log_dir=/var/log

# Type and minimum level of importance of messages to be logged.
#
# The types are "artwork", "database", "general", "http", "inotify",
# "metadata", "scanner", "ssdp" and "tivo".
#
# The levels are "off", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" or "debug".
# "off" turns of logging entirely, "fatal" is the highest level of importance
# and "debug" the lowest.
#
# The types are comma-separated, followed by an equal sign ("="), followed by a
# level that applies to the preceding types. This can be repeated, separating
# each of these constructs with a comma.
#
# The default is to log all types of messages at the "warn" level.
#log_level=general,artwork,database,inotify,scanner,metadata,http,ssdp,tivo=warn
log_level=off

# Use a different container as the root of the directory tree presented to
# clients. The possible values are:
#   * "." - standard container
#   * "B" - "Browse Directory"
#   * "M" - "Music"
#   * "P" - "Pictures"
#   * "V" - "Video"
#   * Or, you can specify the ObjectID of your desired root container
#     (eg. 1$F for Music/Playlists)
# If you specify "B" and the client device is audio-only then "Music/Folders"
# will be used as root.

# Network interface(s) to bind to (e.g. eth0), comma delimited.
# This option can be specified more than once.

# Port number for HTTP traffic (descriptions, SOAP, media transfer).
# This option is mandatory (or it must be specified on the command-line using
# "-p").

# Name that the DLNA server presents to clients.
# Defaults to "hostname: username".

# SSDP notify interval, in seconds.

# passed by the client
# e.g. force_sort_criteria=+upnp:class,+upnp:originalTrackNumber,+dc:title
#force_sort_criteria=

# maximum number of simultaneous connections
# note: many clients open several simultaneous connections while streaming
#max_connections=50

# set this to yes to allow symlinks that point outside user-defined media_dirs.
