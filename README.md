# moOde audio player

moOde provides a beautifully designed and responsive user interface, an extensive set of Audiophile-grade features, a reliable and stable OS  and a friendly, active user Forum that provides expert troubleshooting and support, interesting discussion on a variety of audio topics and an International community of audio enthusiasts.

moOde is a derivative of the wonderful WebUI audio player for MPD originally designed and coded by Andrea Coiutti and Simone De Gregori and subsequently enhanced by early efforts from RaspyFi/Volumio projects. moOde today is a complete redesign of the original WebUI and codebase  and includes highly automated build tooling based on standard Debian packaging and the Pi-gen image builder.
