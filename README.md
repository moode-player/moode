# moOde audio player

Moode Audio Player is a derivative of the wonderful WebUI audio player client for MPD originally designed and coded by Andrea Coiutti and Simone De Gregori, and subsequently enhanced by early efforts from the RaspyFi/Volumio projects.

moOde provides a beautifully designed and responsive user interface, an extensive set of audiophile-class features and an active support forum.
