These are pending tasks, but with a low priority:

- Make a list of external dependencies in each repo.

- Several JS/CSS libraries including Bootstrap, Font Awesome and jQuery are to be bumped.
        Without automated tests, effort to test and debug these lib upgrades is substantial and thus its a low priority ("never touch a running system").

- The backend was refactored a while back. Whats remaining is the JS.
        Without automated tests, efforts to test and debug is substantial and thus its a low priority.

- Add more user setup documentation

- Add more developer documentation

- Publish documentation to github pages
